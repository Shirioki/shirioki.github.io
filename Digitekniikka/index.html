        <h1>Float Right</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, Satan was an angel in heaven, known as Lucifer. He was the most beautiful and powerful of all the angels, and he was also the most proud. Satan grew envious of God's power and decided that he wanted to be like God, so he led a rebellion against God and was cast out of heaven along with the angels who followed him.
            Satan and his followers landed on Earth, where they became known as demons. Satan, now known as the Devil, became the ruler of the underworld and continues to tempt and deceive human beings to this day. He is often portrayed as the enemy of God and the embodiment of evil.
            However, Satan's power is limited, and his ultimate defeat is promised in religious texts. But, Satan still continues to tempt and deceive people, trying to lead them astray from the path of righteousness.
            This is the most common story about Satan in many religions and cultures.</p>
